This Api describes how a library user can get books with ease
by a few parameters like Tile, ISBN, and status.
It also includes information about books that have 
been checked-in and checked-out and the penalty for late
check-in.

I used the above tools to create this application and ran migrations
using entity frameworkcore to my database. The migration folders are in
my project.
